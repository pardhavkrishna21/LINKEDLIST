                                                    ****************to find the middle node of the linked list***************
#brute force:
initally iterating over all the nodes until we get null to find the length , using the length we can iterate upto the length and we can find the middle element.
#optimal:
by using the two pointer concept where we will have two pointers slow_pointer abd fast_pointer
slow_pointer will move slow like it will to next node only
fast_pointer will move fast compare to slow like at one iteration it will move to next 2 nodes
slow_pointer = head.next
fast_pointer=head.next.next
